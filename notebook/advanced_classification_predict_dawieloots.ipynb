Predict overview\n","\n","Many companies are built around lessening one’s environmental impact or carbon footprint. They offer products and services that are environmentally friendly and sustainable, in line with their values and ideals. They would like to determine how people perceive climate change and whether or not they believe it is a real threat. This would add to their market research efforts in gauging how their product/service may be received.\n","\n","With this context, EA is challenging you during the Classification Sprint with the task of creating a Machine Learning model that is able to classify whether or not a person believes in climate change, based on their novel tweet data.\n","\n","Providing an accurate and robust solution to this task gives companies access to a broad base of consumer sentiment, spanning multiple demographic and geographic categories - thus increasing their insights and informing future marketing strategies.\n","\n","My approach to this predict was to build various classification models and then do extensive grid search to find the best parameters.  I've therefore used the concept of a pipeline, as I found that some of the preprocessing steps needed tuning themselves.\n","\n","Before I started with preprocessing, I checked the train and test file for missing values, and found none.  I then proceeded with all the transformations, which are listed below and is self-explanatory.\n","\n","I then trained a few models, such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Adaboost and Naive Bayes and found that Logistic Regression performed the best in terms of a F1 macro score."],"metadata":{"id":"9kHzPAKxhY7A"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":5995,"status":"ok","timestamp":1713265486412,"user":{"displayName":"Dawie Loots","userId":"00798578190767538914"},"user_tz":-120},"id":"h20rlqi05cIw","outputId":"042694c0-9c2f-487c-bfe3-046be4d3460e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n"]}],"source":["# Libraries for data loading, data manipulation and data visulisation\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","import chardet # To provide a best estimate of the encoding that was used in the text data\n","import io # For string operations\n","%matplotlib inline\n","\n","# Libraries for data preparation and model building\n","from imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler\n","from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, TweetTokenizer, TreebankWordTokenizer\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","import string\n","import datetime\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n","from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n","import math\n","import re\n","from sklearn.utils import resample\n","from scipy.sparse import vstack\n","from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix\n","from sklearn import metrics\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler, RobustScaler, MaxAbsScaler\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\n","from sklearn import feature_selection\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectPercentile, SelectKBest, f_classif, mutual_info_classif,chi2, VarianceThreshold\n","from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from gensim.models import Word2Vec\n","import multiprocessing\n","from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import LinearDiscriminantAnalysis\n","from sklearn.discriminant_analysis import QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis\n","from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier\n","import xgboost as xgb\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB, MultinomialNB\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score, log_loss\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV, KFold, StratifiedKFold\n","from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict\n","\n","from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n","from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectFromModel\n","from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, make_scorer\n","from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer\n","from sklearn.preprocessing import FunctionTransformer\n","from sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\n","from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier\n","from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n","from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE,SMOTENC\n","from imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<a id=\"three\"></a>\n","### 3.
